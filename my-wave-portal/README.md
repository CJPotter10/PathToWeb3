Overview
This project is a webpage that connects to a user's metamask wallet to allow the user to wave to me for the chance to win ETH.

Build Process:
  This app was built following a into to web3 course through buildspace.io. I used VS code and hardhat to write, compile, test, as well as deploy my smart contract to Ganache and to the Rinkeby testnet.
  The front end was built on Replt using React and ethers packages. In order to run the front end the command "yarn && yarn start" were used in the replit window.
